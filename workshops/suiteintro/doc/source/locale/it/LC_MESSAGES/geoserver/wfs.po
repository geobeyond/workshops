"A web mapping server can also return the actual geographic data that "
"comprise the map images. This allows users to create their own maps and "
"applications from the data, to convert data between certain formats, and be "
"able to do raw geographic manipulations of served data. The protocol used to"
" return geographic feature data is called **Web Feature Service (WFS)**."
