"WPS extends the web mapping server to provide geospatial analysis. WPS in "
"GeoServer allows for direct integration with other GeoServer services and "
"the data catalog. This means that it is possible to create processes based "
"on data served in GeoServer, including the results of a process to be stored"
" as a new layer. In this way, WPS acts as a full browser-based geospatial "
"analysis tool, capable of reading and writing data from and to GeoServer."
