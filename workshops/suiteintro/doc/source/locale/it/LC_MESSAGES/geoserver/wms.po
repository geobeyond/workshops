"A fundamental component of the web map (and likely the simplest to "
"understand) is the map image. **The Web Map Service (WMS)** is a standard "
"protocol for serving georeferenced map images generated by a map server."

msgid ""
"In short, WMS is a way for a client to request map images from a server. The"
" client sends a request to a map server, then the map server generates an "
"image based on parameters passed to the server in the request and finally "
"returns an image."

"The source material from which the image is generated need not be an image. "
"The WMS generates an image from whatever source material is requested, which"
" could be vector data, raster data, or a combination of the two."
