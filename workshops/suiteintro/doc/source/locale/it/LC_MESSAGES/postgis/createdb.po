"PostgreSQL has a number of administrative front-ends. `psql "

"desktop utility `pgAdmin <http://www.pgadmin.org/>`_ is a tool that provides"
" similar functionality with a graphical front-end. In this workshop, we're "
"going to use pgAdmin, but all of the queries that can be done in pgAdmin can"
